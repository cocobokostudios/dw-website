This is the spiritual sequel to my previous {% post_link 2016-01-01-Highlight-Reel-for-2015 &amp;ldquo;Highlight Reel for 2015&amp;rdquo; %} post. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to read it previously, but it might provide some context on some of these ideas.
I decided that with everything still in flux and forever changing, it&amp;rsquo;s easier for me to list out the interests and ideas, rather than concrete requirements for individual projects. Not sure how they&amp;rsquo;ll pan out exactly, but here&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;what, why, and how&amp;rdquo; for the plan for 2016.</description>

I just finished reading my post about 2014. If I were to compare my plans for 2015 to the result of the year-long sprint, I&amp;rsquo;d have to say that it appears that we are either way off track, or that the requirements have changed quite a bit.
2015 has been great, with all sorts of chaos thrown throughout. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll share with you the highlights and the lessons learned from those events.</description>
