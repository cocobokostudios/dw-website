      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a game dev, but have always wanted to make a video game. I&amp;rsquo;ve started and stopped so many project over the years, that I have seriously lost count.
With the new year and a fresh mind, I decided to take a stab at it again, this time focusing on just getting something done rather than getting something done right as a sort of side project.
It&amp;rsquo;s been about two months since I&amp;rsquo;ve started, and I have something basic working (although I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to share it yet) and I thought I would share my thoughts on Phaser, the framework I decided to use to help me build my game.</description>
