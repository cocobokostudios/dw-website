      <description>Chakra is the new JavaScript engine developed by Microsoft, which was first released as part of the, no longer supported Internet Explorer 9. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a post about why Microsoft having more open source software (OSS) processes and projects is important, or how it is &amp;ldquo;amazing&amp;rdquo; that they are turning a new leaf.
This post answers the question that I don&amp;rsquo;t see people asking: why is having a OSS JavaScript engine important to anyone?</description>
