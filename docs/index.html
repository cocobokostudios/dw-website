                A Note from DW
            </h2>

                <p>This is the official website for davidwesst, a.k.a. DW, a.k.a. Wessty.</p>
                <p>I managed to break something on the old site. Not sure what, but it's definitely broken, so rather than try and fix a thing I didn't understand (i.e. Hugo) I decided to stick to what I know, which is JavaScript.</p>
                <p>The catch is that I spend most of my B-time working on game development rather than web code, so I'll get to it eventually. :)</p>
