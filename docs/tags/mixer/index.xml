      <description>I recently started streaming twice a week on Mixer. The streams happen at 9:30pm CT (7:30pm PT or 10:30pm ET) on Thursdays and Sundays. Thursdays are Code Nights where I fumble through the creation of a video game. Sundays are Play Nights I play and analyze a game that has something interesting in it. No specific topic, just play and talk about game with the intent of finding interesting design in games.</description>
