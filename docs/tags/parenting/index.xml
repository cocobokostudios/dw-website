      <description>I recently came off of four months of parental leave where I had a fantastic time bonding with my new daughter. Although four months doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like much of a hiatus, I learned very quickly that being a full time parent doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave much time to keeping my professional edge.
They might seem obvious, but it took me a while to find a balance to make sure spending time with my daughter didn&amp;rsquo;t play second fiddle to my profession passion and/or obsession.</description>
