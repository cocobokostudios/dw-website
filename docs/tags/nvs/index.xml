      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s another dev thing I use: NVS, a cross-platform Node version manager that works for Windows.
It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I like JavaScript, which includes Node. The history of Node releases has been fast, furious, and somewhat turbulent which led to a lot of different versions of Node being released. Manually managing the version of Node in you development enviornment is painful, just like it is for Java. For the Linux and Unix people, there was nvm and n, but nothing really comparable for Windows.</description>
