      <description>This is the April 2017 update for my video game project I call &amp;ldquo;Conquest&amp;rdquo;.
This month, I have continued to make progress on my game project. The unexpected thing that happened was the fact that I decided to take a step back and do some research and development before continuing forward with the game idea I have in mind.
Status Update Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: my game project is too big. At least for now, it&amp;rsquo;s too big, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough experience and knowledge to be co fortable taking this idea and turning it into a game.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve toyed and tinkered with different game ideas and technologies through the years, but never really got anything done. At the beginning of this year, I started working on something I decided would be my first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; game.</description>
