      <description>Last weekend I released an updated version of my blog and website that share a similar design. I decided to go with a mobile-first approach when it came to the design, which is a tried and tested way to create responsive web applications. Along the way, I tripped up and made a few mistakes that cost me some time and rework, but could have been easily corrected had I had these tips beforehand.</description>

      <title>Using text-overflow:ellipsis with Inline Flex</title>

      <description>Dave Paquette, a fellow Western Dev, hit a strange CSS snag the other day. He wanted to use the text-overflow: ellipsis on a flexbox item that displayed text, where the ellipsis would show up if the text was too long.
It didn&amp;rsquo;t work as expected, but after some digging, a solution was discovered. This post exists to document both the problem and solution with the hope that it prevents future headaches for other CSS developers.</description>
