18-Aug-21,Princess Tomato and the Salad Kingdom,NES, $203.75 , $372.00 , Price Charting ,, No ,3,"Text-based adventure that gets players to explore different ""rooms"" in a level and solve puzzles to advance to the next level. Expected to trial and error yourself into soft locks and solutions by restarting the level using the password system.",4,"Number of action buttons, but purely text driven.",2,Puzzles sometime require repeated action taken on a single item until the 3rd or 4th attempt gives you a different response.,1,Fine,None,"Because of the repeated action requirement on the puzzles, the collaboration would be less interesting and more of a ""try this boring thing""",Exploration of a weird world where all the graphics have a text-based description,Soft locking yourself in a level and needing to restart.,"Weird world and cheezy dialogue and story kept me there. It especially worked in the first level, but didn't last for the second level once I soft locked myself in a few different ways.",Test,20-Jul-21,,
18-Aug-21,Maniac Mansion,NES, $21.26 , $101.79 , Price Charting ,, Yes ,4,"Interactive SCUMM game where you solve puzzles with a group of three teens (out of 7), each with a special skill that can enable different actions, ending, and story in the game",3,"Uses command interface with d-pad cursor, which is a bit awkward. Can use common commands with select button, but clearly a PC port.",4,"Enjoyable, even with the occasional moon logic puzzle. Would probably be lower if I didn't already have a familiarity with the game.",,,Collaborative,"Any idea is plausible and having extra another perspective can unlock new endings, content, or areas. This actually happened on stream by finding a new ""death"" ending with the green tentacle.","The combination of humour, mystery, and exploration. Especially the exploration factor, as there are a lot of rooms to explore in the game, each with its own set of secrets.",Moon logic puzzles. Sometimes the threads to lead you to a solution are very thin or not obvious at all.,The humour and weirdness definitely make you want to stay. They bring you in with little vignettes or cut-scenes to introduce you to the weirdness the family in the mansion causes and lives with.,,27-Jul-21,,
18-Aug-21,Mission: Impossible,NES, $3.02 , $24.67 , Price Charting ,, Yes ,4,"Combination of puzzle solving and action. Very Metal Geat, but very cool to see the combination of action gameplay and puzzle solving in an NES title. Mutliple ways through a level is provides a bit of openness to the game, although quite limiting.",4,"Each character has specialties and feels different, which works for the game. Need to learn who is right for the job.",3,"Quite difficult without FAQ, and still challenging even with an FAQ. Need to explore the level to figure out what you need to do to progress and that usually involves a lot of death by trial and error.",,,Collaborative,"A second mind and a second pair of hands to play through the level would have been very helpful for breaks and less ""git gud"" issues.","The multistep process to solve the level. It really does feel like you need to think like a spy team to make it work, although it appears that you're not totally blocked if you lose one of your characters.","The trial and error gameplay without a mid-level save point. Need to get good at the different tasks, which you do by repeating them over and over again, but it's not a style of gamplay that has aged particularily well.","The sandbox and puzzle of figuring out how to progress in kept me playing and made me want to ""git gud"".",,10-Aug-21,,
24-Aug-21,Metal Gear,NES, $17.44 , $149.00 , Price Charting ,, Yes ,5,"Linear, but quite fun especially for the time. Exploration component is really good because the game needs you to leave no stone unturned, and your are rewarded for it..",3,"They actually use the select button, which is not something I use today. Also got stuck on corner pixels occasionally.",4,"No way to ID doors with cards, unlike misssion Impossible with the switches",,,None,this is exclusively a one player experience,Exploration of the base and the jungle was awesome and rewarding. Also felt good to git gud as I played the same areas over again. Story was a nice addition too.,"Without an FAQ this would have been a bit of a grind for, but not bad. ","Exploration and the story, but mainly the former. You are rewarded with new items, process, etc.. In very quick bursts for exploring all the things and under all the rocks.",,24-Aug-21,,
31-Aug-21,Metal Gear Solid (Greatest Hits),PS1,$20.00,$35.76, Price Charting , Greatest Hits version , Yes ,4,"It's a cinematic sneaky game, one of the first big ones that I can remember, and it's fun (even if I'm bad at it)",4,"The controls are good, but I definitely need practice to get used to them. Played with a DualShock 2 with rumble, but can imagine it would have been harder with just the d-pad.",3,"It's stealth, which is fine, just not my favourite.",,,Couch,"I think someone backseatting would enjoy this because it's pretty much like a movie, and I could probably use the help on parts that are ""easy"".","The story and the flavour around the story. Between the different characters you can call on the radio, you get different ideas from different people on what's going on. Considering it's a solo stealth game, its really impressive they manage this B-rate story with so many different characters through just the codec screen.","The sneakiness and the need to practice with the controls. That's probably more of a ""me"" problem, but it's definitely less fun for me for that reason. I like feeling in control in the first 15 minutes or so.","That flavour (see the fun) really keeps me wanting to meet new characters and figure out what is going on. In the first two hours, it kept the story beats flowing",,31-Aug-21,,
14-Sep-21,Castlevania II: Simon's Quest,NES,$15.00,$83.27, Price Charting ,, No ,2,"Progress without an FAQ means searching for secrets using holy water on every brick you can find. Leads to items, and more importantly, hint books. Not a fan, but good with an FAQ.",4,Feels like Castlevania for the NES with RPG mechanics.,2,The puzzles are really just item puzzles obscured through a lack of hints and secret block hunting,,,None,"This is a single player experience. Might help with someone on the couch with an FAQ, but not really necessary to enjoy it more.","Exploring the world, finding the towns, and trying to learn everything you can. The controls feel great and once you get the hang of it, it's a cool way to explore the game world.","Secret blocks and invisible blocks (i.e. they look like they are there, but they aren't). Spamming holy water is not fun.","The controls combined with the mystery of exploring the world. Upgrading your character also feels pretty good, especially in the early part of the game.",,14-Sep-21,,
21-Sep-21,Castlevania: Symphony of the Night,PS1,$67.73,$144.37, Price Charting ,, No ,4,"Platforming mechanics mashed up with RPG mechanics works really well. It explains why people love ""Metroidvania"" experiences and this is the point that really helped polish the genre (assuming you call it that).",3,"Platforming feels good, much better than NES style Castlevania (i.e. controlling jumps in air). Didn't like that the attack animation couldn't be cancelled and the backslide felt a bit odd at the beginning as I would hit back and triangle, only to slide into my enemy instead of away. Something that could be fixed with practice, but didn't feel right.",2,"Only came across one of these, and it was…fine. Needed to use an item to make it work, and I figured it out a little too late as the reward was weaker than the weapon I earned defeating the first boss.",,,None,"This is a single player experience, straight up. Don't even think couch co-op would do it, but wouldn't hurt.","Exploration. That castle seems to have a lot of backtracking, secrets, and areas that will only be accessible with new skills and items. Classic Metroidvania style gameplay, and you get rewarded for it. Plus, tacky voice acting to the max.","The controls a bit, but really the ""less fun"" part was that there wasn't anything that blew me away when playing it for the first time. Maybe it was just the hype, or maybe it's just not what I'm looking for…but Simon's Quest seems more interesting to me than this.","Exploration times a thousand. As you level up, gain items, and skills, more and more of the castle will become open to you.",,21-Sep-21,,
28-Sep-21,Elemental Gearbolt,PS1,$76.44,$230.77, Price Charting ,, No ,3,"It's a rail shooter with limited continues even on the easiest difficulty. It's what average, although it definitely has it's moments.",2,"Without a light gun, it's twitchy cursor movement, and I'm not a fan of that one bit",0,There are no puzzles. It's a rail shooter.,,,Couch,"I think playing this with someone would have been a lot of fun. I felt I was getting better, even after 2 hours, and I think it would have been even easier with 2 people getting better that whole time.","The cutscenes and getting good. When you do manage to make progress and get a bit better, you certainly feel good. Especially after you beat the boss.",The git gud stuff that all rail shooters have.,"The RPG mashup and the cutscenes. This is a Working Designs game and that means it has anime cutscenes, weak voice acting, and some good weirdness.",,28-Sep-21,,
12-Oct-21,Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom,SNES,$13.99,$40.64, Price Charting ,, Yes ,2,"Gameplay is just menus, so it's getting a lower score, but it is exactly what it should be for the time. I think today you could still do the same style of menuing gameplay, but include some quality of life stuff and a few more animations",4,"For navigating menus and a maze, it works very well. ",4,"The puzzle aspect is about how to discover, explore, support a long lived team of explorers in-game, while keeping tabs of your own map out of game. I suppose the puzzle is just map making and navigation, but it really had its hooks in me.",,,Couch,Someone to make the map while you navigated so that you didn't need to put the controller down.,"Map making and navigation-- although I can see how many would find this tedious. I bet I would even find it tedious after a few days of gameplay. Still, it had be interested with the way the puzzle happened outside of the game itself. Sure, the computer could have given me a map, but that would have made it easier...although I think having an in-game map that showed me the walls, but left me to fill in the markers and highlights would have been a big quality of life improvement.","Lack of help, tutorials, or in-game explanation of how things worked in town. Maybe things were explained in the instructions (which I didn't have when I played) but there was a lot of exploring menus and taking guessing on what I needed to do to fix things up. Took a while, especially at the beginning, to make a party and get moving with them.","Map creation and disposable player characters. This game is about exploration AND navigation. That navigation is up to the player's ability to either know there way around the maze, or their ability to draw a map. Since everything looks the same, the map making is the most likely choice, and it was really pretty fun.",,12-Oct-21,,
02-Nov-21,River King: A Wonderful Journey,PS2,$9.49,$24.73, Price Charting ,, Yes ,3,"Gameplay is really just a regular JRPG fishing mini-game turned into a full-fledge game. It could use some ""breaks"" in doing the fishing, or possibly some extra challenge. Maybe there is later on, but after two hours I didn't find much.",4,"Simple and intuitive, but could use some better quality of life shortcut buttons or key combos for adding bait to the hook and such.",2,"It's exploring, gathering tips, and figuring out how to fish. There isn't really a lot of thought, just searching around the massive land mass for fish.",,,None,"This is a single player experience, through and through.","Exploraion and finding the fish is fun. There is the whole collect them all thing, combined with the narrative and RPG elements of dealing with townsfolk and doing fishing challenges too. The key is exploration, which gives you quite the burst of joy when you finally do find something.","The emptiness of it all. The Stream level was huge, where it took 20-30 seconds to find the next building. I probably didn't even explore everything, and I know there are other levels I didn't even see that early on in the game. It's just too big for too little content to engage with you.","Collect-a-thon and exploration. You want to get all the fish, and there are tricks to all of them (i.e. bait, lures, and so on). I think it would have had more impact if there was some versatility to the figuring out how to catch the fish or even some direction.",,02-Nov-21,,
16-Nov-21,Ultima VI: The False Prophet,SNES,$1.60,$4.25, Price Charting ,, Yes ,2,"This game feels like a lofi Elder Scolls game, except all the of the story and lore is gated by inside jokes from the first five games. You get setup and set off into the world, but the catch is that you need to level up and go on adventures to get yourself ready to take on the first tasks. They don't tell you that, and that's fine, but there wasn't anything else to really immerse yourself in except to talk to people about how great you were in the previous games. After the first hour of that, I grew tired of it and just wanted to get a pinch of direction.",3,"Good. They are turn-based, and are fine. Felt good enough on the SNES, but didn't really do anything special on the hardware. Rather, it felt like you could have done almost everything on an NES controller.",2,"The only puzzle was figuring out how to get out of the castle, which was really a tutorial on how to control the player and explore the world. Sometimes it felt like they were trying simulate a little too much of the medival English times environment, but then again, maybe that's just part of the Ultima experience. Wasn't bad, but wasn't really interesting either.",,,None,Single player RPG. Plain and simple.,"Exploration, although I'm sure I would get more if I spent the time learning about the previous games and understanding the story behind each relic in the museum. It seemed like the characters were all reoccuring characters from the previous games, as confimed by chat.",The inside joke style lore and immediate need to level. That was really how all console games went prior to Final Fantasy-- but it didn't really age well.,"The humour. If I spent more time exploring and learning about the characters, I think I would have gotten some more out of it, but the writing was pretty decent, even if I didn't get a lot of the references.",,09-Nov-21,,
16-Nov-21,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,XB,$8.49,$13.25, Price Charting ,, Yes ,4,"Big open world. Classic western style RPG. It's almost overwhelming how open and large the game is, especially for its time. The system of practice improves the skill is one that I'm no longer familiar with, as it's been a while since I played Oblivion or Skyrim, but I still think it holds a certain charm, even though it make it weird watching the player sneak and jump everywhere.",3,"Movement feels fine, but fighting felt weird. It's a dice roll on each hit, and although it looks like you're connecting-- unless you see blood or get some kind of confirmation, you it's not actually a hit.",2,"Didn't come across many puzzles. Only the ""dialogue"" puzzle of getting people to like you. It's fine. Pretty simple and feels pretty random, but it's just that: fine. Not good, not great, not bad, just fine.",,,None,"Single player only. Someone may watch, but it's a single player RPG, through and through.","For me it was the exploration. Just being dropped into this world and reading about it's weirdness is amazing. Giant insects that are driven like buses by the driver moving their organs…it's just bizarre and facinating, all at the same time. The look is a little dirty and dusty, but there is a lot to explore and I think I could get into it.","The battle system. As much as it could have just been me, I really didn't find it easy or intuitive to understand how to land a hit. It's more likely me, but the fact that I didn't really understand or know after two hours, feels like the game missed something.","The freedom. You get moving and you're off to do whatever it is you need to do. There is a main campaign, but they even tell you to go off and get yourself involved in guilds and such before you continue the main quest and become a ""blade"". ",,16-Nov-21,,
