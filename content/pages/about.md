# Hey Friendo, it's DW.

You might know me as Wessty, or David Wesst, or that guy from that conference that one time. Either way, if you're here we should be friends.

I'm a professional technologist by day and an amateur creative by night, focusing mostly on video games, video game development, and searching for inspiration for the next thing. In a previous life, I was a Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) that focused on front-end web dev technology, but left that behind to focus more on family (I have children and I like being quite involved in their lives) and my passion for video games.
