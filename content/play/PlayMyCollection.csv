18-Aug-21,Princess Tomato and the Salad Kingdom,NES, $203.75 , $372.00 , No ,3,"Text-based adventure that gets players to explore different ""rooms"" in a level and solve puzzles to advance to the next level. Expected to trial and error yourself into soft locks and solutions by restarting the level using the password system.",4,"Number of action buttons, but purely text driven.",2,Puzzles sometime require repeated action taken on a single item until the 3rd or 4th attempt gives you a different response.,None,"Because of the repeated action requirement on the puzzles, the collaboration would be less interesting and more of a ""try this boring thing""",Exploration of a weird world where all the graphics have a text-based description,Soft locking yourself in a level and needing to restart.,"Weird world and cheezy dialogue and story kept me there. It especially worked in the first level, but didn't last for the second level once I soft locked myself in a few different ways.",20-Jul-21,https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1093126572,https://youtu.be/vhuMWoQksIA,
18-Aug-21,Maniac Mansion,NES, $21.26 , $101.79 , Yes ,4,"Interactive SCUMM game where you solve puzzles with a group of three teens (out of 7), each with a special skill that can enable different actions, ending, and story in the game",3,"Uses command interface with d-pad cursor, which is a bit awkward. Can use common commands with select button, but clearly a PC port.",4,"Enjoyable, even with the occasional moon logic puzzle. Would probably be lower if I didn't already have a familiarity with the game.",Collaborative,"Any idea is plausible and having extra another perspective can unlock new endings, content, or areas. This actually happened on stream by finding a new ""death"" ending with the green tentacle.","The combination of humour, mystery, and exploration. Especially the exploration factor, as there are a lot of rooms to explore in the game, each with its own set of secrets.",Moon logic puzzles. Sometimes the threads to lead you to a solution are very thin or not obvious at all.,The humour and weirdness definitely make you want to stay. They bring you in with little vignettes or cut-scenes to introduce you to the weirdness the family in the mansion causes and lives with.,27-Jul-21,https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1100302727,,
18-Aug-21,Mission: Impossible,NES, $3.02 , $24.67 , Yes ,4,"Combination of puzzle solving and action. Very Metal Geat, but very cool to see the combination of action gameplay and puzzle solving in an NES title. Mutliple ways through a level is provides a bit of openness to the game, although quite limiting.",4,"Each character has specialties and feels different, which works for the game. Need to learn who is right for the job.",3,"Quite difficult without FAQ, and still challenging even with an FAQ. Need to explore the level to figure out what you need to do to progress and that usually involves a lot of death by trial and error.",Collaborative,"A second mind and a second pair of hands to play through the level would have been very helpful for breaks and less ""git gud"" issues.","The multistep process to solve the level. It really does feel like you need to think like a spy team to make it work, although it appears that you're not totally blocked if you lose one of your characters.","The trial and error gameplay without a mid-level save point. Need to get good at the different tasks, which you do by repeating them over and over again, but it's not a style of gamplay that has aged particularily well.","The sandbox and puzzle of figuring out how to progress in kept me playing and made me want to ""git gud"".",10-Aug-21,https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1114646759,,
