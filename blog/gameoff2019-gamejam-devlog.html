<p>For the past year or so, I've been working on learning and getting into video game development (a.k.a. gamedev) as a sort of side thing to the whole enterprise cloud architect thing that I do during the day.</p>
<p>In order to focus my effort, I decided that I would participate in the GitHub hosted <a href="https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019">GameOff 2019 Game Jam on Itch.io</a>. It's been a ride to say the least, but as I've been doing it, I've been doing a devlog series on YouTube about my progress and my thoughts throughout the competition.</p>
<h2>Where Do I Find the Vlog?</h2>
<p>You're in the right spot, as I'm going to cross post my <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> project devlog posts here, but you can also follow along on my <a href="https://youtube.com/davidwesst">YouTube channel</a> if you're into that sort of thing, or you can just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbTA1UhK0wKjTEEc_wO1n0w_hPAUIeVRf">checkout the playlist here</a>.</p>
<p>The game jam ends on December 1, and there is more work to be done, so stay tuned for more posts.</p>
