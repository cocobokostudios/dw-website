<hr>
<p>I've been tinkering with Visual Studio Team Services off and on since its public release, but never did anything really productive with it. Over the past couple of weeks, I finally bit the bullet and decided to move my most prevelant personal project into VSTS: this blog.</p>
<p>This post covers the setup, and more specifically what I use to produce my lovely blog. We'll get into the thick of it in <a href="https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-2/">part 2</a>.</p>
<h3>Woah. VSTS <em>just</em> for a Blog?</h3>
<p>I know. Let me address this first before we continue.</p>
<p>It's definitely overkill. But, it provided me with a great learning experience for VSTS and the application lifecycle management tools is provides. It also was something that I'll actually use on a regular basis, as you'll see if you get through the whole series of posts.</p>
<p>So, yes it's like using a grenade launcher to kill an ant. That being said, it definitely gets the job done.</p>
<h2>The Parts</h2>
<p>Here's what I use in my blog project, and what you'll need if you're going to follow along.</p>
<h3>Hexo or another Static Site Generator</h3>
<p>If you're not familiar with static site generators, they are great for developers looking to blog or create simple sites. I won't be going into the details on how to use one, but they all seem to provide a similar sort of experience.</p>
<p>All you do is add files, generally in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>, fill out the configuration file, and run the generate command. The generator then generates a series of static HTML files from your content and then you have the files you need to publish to a web server somewhere.</p>
<p>No server-side code, no database, just a bunch of files. Real simple.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> for my <a href="https://blog.davidwesst.com">blog</a>, and it is used for the <a href="http://www.westerndevs.com">Western Devs</a> site. It works well, and makes scripting your build and deployment (<a href="https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-3/">which we'll see later</a>) much easier.</p>
<p>If you don't like Hexo then take a <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">look here</a> for a bunch of static site generators based in a variety of languages.</p>
<h3>Visual Studio Team Services Account</h3>
<p>Sign up for the free account <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vsts-test/">here</a> and create a new team project. I used the <em>Agile</em> process because I found it gave me the flexibility I wanted, and <em>Git</em> for source control.</p>
<p>If you want more details about the project processes available, and the differences between them, take a look at <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/guidance/choose-process">this link</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CYlb9sNm.png" alt="&#x22;Create a New Project in VSTS&#x22;"></p>
<h3>Web Host</h3>
<p>Just like any website, you're going to need a place to host it. Lucky for us, we're only hosting static files which makes the options pretty open.</p>
<p>I'm using Windows Azure, which again is overkill considering it's just static files, but I like it. If you don't want to spend money, I have also used <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> which is free and works just as well for what we'll be doing.</p>
<p>The important part is having a place to host the files once they are generated. No more, no less.</p>
<h3>Web Browser</h3>
<p>VSTS is browser-based, so get a your favourite modern browser, get it updated, and you're good to go.</p>
<h3>Code Editor</h3>
<p>We're not going to be doing much code, but it'll come in handy later on. </p>
<p>Personally, I jump between <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. I'm sure you have your favourite, and that'll do just fine for our purposes.</p>
<h2>You Forgot Visual Studio</h2>
<p>No I didn't. I don't use Visual Studio, nor do we need it.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't like it, but it's too heavy for the amount of coding I actually do for my blog. VSTS provides us with a web-based user interface that does everything we need for managing the source code, builds, and so on. </p>
<p>In conclusion, I don't use Visual Studio here because I don't need it. </p>
<h2>And We're Ready</h2>
<p>Armed with our toolbox of goodies and our project created, we're good to go on starting to blog with VSTS. <a href="https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-2/">Next up</a>, we'll starting with what is familiar and getting our code into VSTS. </p>
