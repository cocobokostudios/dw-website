This blog post will ensure that not only I remember, but the entire Internet will remember the solution I use.</p>\n<p>Here goes.</p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>The problem is simple: You pull down a repository that uses NPM for package management onto your Windows machine, you type <code>npm install</code> and you get something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>npm ERR! Failed at the &#x3C;package>@&#x3C;version> install script 'node-gyp rebuild'\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>gyp ERR! stack Error: Can't find Python executable \"python\", you can set the PYTHON env variable.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is because the project you're trying to build requires the <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp\">node-gyp</a> package to build something natively on the platform. That package required Python 2.7 and a few other pieces too.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Simple problems sometimes get simple solutions.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the node-gyp team, that is the case and they have documented it in the project <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp\">README</a>.</p>\n<p>Using a <em>PowerShell</em> CLI instance with administrative priviledges, and use the following code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install --global --production windows-build-tools\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that's it.</p>\n<p>There is a manual option as well, but I haven't needed to use it as the first option always works for me.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Fix node-gyp Error on Windows"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-to-fix-node-gyp-error-on-windows/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
