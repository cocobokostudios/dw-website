Booya.</p>\n<h3>Uh...Why is that Cool?</h3>\n<p>Well, SimCity is probably my favourite game of all time. Not the PC one specifically, but the SNES port that came out a bit later.</p>\n<p>And I contributed code to it.</p>\n<p>In my favourite language.</p>\n<p>Sploosh. (<a href=\"http://youtu.be/HC1NqZvY_lA?t=6s\">Reference is Kinda NSFW Audio from Archer</a>)</p>\n<h3>You Didn't Contribute Much</h3>\n<p>True, but I still contributed and that is the point. This represents something else to me.</p>\n<p>Plus, having a pull request accepted by an open source project is a new experience for me. If you go back two years, the idea of me being part of anything open source would have been ludacrous.</p>\n<p>Now, as more of a coding hobbyist rather than a professional (as I don't get paid to code much anymore), I'm talking open source projects and use not much more than a terminal and text editor to develop and build all my code.</p>\n<p>It's something of a major milestone in my personal and professional evolution.</p>\n<h2>The Point</h2>\n<p><img src=\"file54531acb193b9.jpg\">\nPhoto credit: <a href=\"http://www.morguefile.com/creative/GaborfromHungary\">GaborfromHungary</a> from <a href=\"http://www.morguefile.com/\">morguefile.com</a></p>\n<p>It's pretty direct: MicropolisJS is awesome, and so is open source. If you want to be awesome (like me) <a href=\"https://github.com/graememcc/micropolisJS\">fork the project</a> and help out a bit.</p>\n<p>If you don't want to help, it's still a cool set of source code to download and play with to see a full working game in HTML and JavaScript. One that you can really recognize.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing. ~ DW</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"SimCity in the Browser...with Source Code"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/simcity-in-the-browser-with-source-code/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
