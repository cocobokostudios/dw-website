The first two hours with Charles, Paula, and Jacob, there are there's a few others that caught my eye.</p>\n<h6>Hosted web apps and web platform innovations</h6>\n<p><em>May 5, 12pm EDT</em> --\nThey announced the idea of \"hosted web-apps\" at Build 2015, where web developers could extend their existing web applications to use native Windows features under specific conditions, like achievements in XBox. This should shed some light on this from the team that is making it possible.</p>\n<h6>Create Fun &#x26; Immersive Audio Experiences with Web Audio</h6>\n<p><em>May 6, 12pm EDT</em> --\nWeb Audio is cool, and I want to see how to use it in my applications. So, that's pretty self explanitory.</p>\n<h6>Whatâ€™s new in the F12 Developer Tools</h6>\n<p><em>May 6, 10am EDT</em> --\nI like F12 developer tools, and the improvements they've been making have bee great so far. I'm eager to see what Andy has in store of us in the next big release.</p>\n<h6>Advancing JavaScript Without Breaking the Web</h6>\n<p><em>May 6, 11am EDT</em> --\nPeople seem to forget that JavaScript is a 20 year old language, and the fact that we are still using today the old stuff remains compatible. It's impressive really, but takes some serious effort. I'm curious to know how the community is advancing my langugage of choice without changing it completely.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Living on the (Microsoft) Edge on May 5 & 6"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/living-on-the-microsoft-edge-on-may-5-6/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
