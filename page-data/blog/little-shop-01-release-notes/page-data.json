The 0.1 beta has arrived for Little Shop of Wall Street!</p>\n<p>In this video, DW walks through the new features rolled out both in-game and behind the scenes for his LD46 game jam title.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/baMlNqGgiV4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Side Notes</h2>\n<p>This release is an important one for me. </p>\n<p>First, off it's the first \"beta\" release which I've categorized as a moderately stable release, and includes a \"complete gameplay loop\" on purpose. There are still plenty of bugs (as the video even showed) but it works and playable.</p>\n<p>Second, this release is the original vision of what I pictured the gamejam submission to be when D'Arcy and I came up with the idea back in April. Many months later, I have that release which says a lot about my prototyping and experimenting process (i.e. I'm too slow).</p>\n<p>Lastly, I have multiple versions of the game out there including Linux/X11 and Windows versions. There's still a lot more to learn and do with the while devops setup for my projects, but this is a great step forward and can be reused with all my Godot-based projects moving forward.</p>\n<p>Until the next one-- thanks for playing.</p>\n<p>~ DW</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Release Notes for Little Shop of Wall Street 0.1.0-beta"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/little-shop-01-release-notes/"}}}
