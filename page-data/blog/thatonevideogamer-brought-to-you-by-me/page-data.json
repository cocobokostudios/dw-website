In that time, I found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPYJR2EIu0_MJaDeSGwkIVw\">ThatOneVideoGamer on YouTube</a> and really started to look at YouTube and web-based video as a serious entertainment medium.</p>\n<p>That lead me to the rest of their shows (links below) which are all professionally done, funny, and genuine. They've set a high standard for web-based videos, and I look forward to them continuing!</p>\n<p>Long story short, I wanted to put my money where my mouth is and support this group that make shows that lead me to cancel my cable subscription.</p>\n<h3>The Point</h3>\n<p>No real point other than the team at ThatOneVideoGamer is great and if you like video games and video game humour, you should <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPYJR2EIu0_MJaDeSGwkIVw\">check</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperScopeShow\">out</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ThatOneLaserClown\">their</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheNationalDex\">shows</a>.</p>\n<p>If you really like them, then <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ThatOneVideoGamer\">support them</a>, like me.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ThatOneVideoGamer Brought To You By: Me"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/thatonevideogamer-brought-to-you-by-me/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
