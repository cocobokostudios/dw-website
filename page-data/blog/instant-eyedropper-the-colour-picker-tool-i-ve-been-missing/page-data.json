Now the code display disappears, but you have the value saved in the clipboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"blog_instanteyedropper_3.png\"></p>\n<p>Easy, peezy, lemon squeezy.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I know that there are a million or so of these kinds of apps out there. My favourite being the one built into the Internet Explorer F12 developer tools. But, this one lets you go outside of the browser window easily, and does exactly what I need it to do. Also, it's out of the way, but always readily accessible.</p>\n<p>Great tool. You should download it.</p>\n<p>End Scene. </p>\n<p>~ DW</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Instant Eyedropper: The Colour Picker Tool I've Been Missing"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/instant-eyedropper-the-colour-picker-tool-i-ve-been-missing/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
