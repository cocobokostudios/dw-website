Unfortunately, I have no news to share with anyone. It's unlikely that Microsoft would have secretly been building a whole new browser, but who knows.</p>\n<p>Personally, I'm just interested in the amount of buzz this story is getting. Give IE a Halo-based code name and suddenly the whole internet is interested in Microsoft finally \"killing\" IE.</p>\n<h2>The Point</h2>\n<p>No point really other than this whole conversation and about this story is facinating, along with the buzz people are creating around it.</p>\n<p>The video flat out says \"it will use Trident and Chakra\", which represent huge parts of IE.</p>\n<p>Being that Windows 10 is blurring the touch and desktop interfaces, maybe this is just a rebranding exercise to clean the slate for consumers, but keep IE alive for the enterprise.</p>\n<p>In any case, it's all speculation. I'm looking forward to the January event and hope to see some cool representation from IE at the headlining press event.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"IE...err...Spartan Makes IGN News"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ie-err-spartan-makes-ign-news/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
