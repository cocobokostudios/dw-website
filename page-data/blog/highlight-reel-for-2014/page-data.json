Get to the Point is <a href=\"http://youtu.be/M5OQchl9bQA\">the first video</a> of a series of short videos I plan on talking about code, video games, and hybrid topics in between.</p>\n<p>It's something I've wanted to do for quite some time now, and here's hoping I keep it up in 2015.</p>\n<h3>Viva la Blog</h3>\n<p>If you're reading this, then you might have noticed I've been blogging pretty regularily for the past few months. Not just here, but I had a <a href=\"http://d.wes.st/1yroBzI\">whole series on getting Ghost on Azure</a>, complete with a custom theme and SSL on the Canadian Developer Connection.</p>\n<p>The blog really was a great outlet for me to help me figure out what I wanted to do with my professional side, or whatever you want to call what I do.</p>\n<p>The plan is to keep that up. It's a good way for me to play around with ideas and content and share 'em with you fine people.</p>\n<h3>Back into the Speaker Spotlight</h3>\n<p>{% asset<em>img imaginet-html5event</em>small.jpg %}</p>\n<p>That's an old picture of me, but you can imagine that my reintroduction into public speaking looked that awesome.</p>\n<p>I took over a year off of public speaking, but broke the silence with a Winnipeg .NET User Group presentation I call Going Terminal: Learning to be IDE Free.</p>\n<p>In 2015, I'll be heading to <a href=\"http://www.prairiedevcon.com/\">Prairie Dev Con</a>, here in Winnipeg, to present on a new dev story where we go from Web to Mobile App using Cordova.</p>\n<h3>Actually Finishing Up Projects</h3>\n<p><img src=\"newzvgqtitle.PNG\"></p>\n<p>Given I consider my blog and website far from complete, I have made some serious strides in focusing the time I have to code projects and have actually seen progress.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/zvgq/zvgq\">biggest project</a> has been the \"New\" Zany Video Game Quotes website. Something I've been slowly working on with one of my closest friends for years. It's only now, nearly 5 years later, that I have something to show.</p>\n<p>I didn't quite get everything I wanted done for January 1, but I made some serious progress and have something to show for it.</p>\n<p>Expect more details on what I've learned and have planned for that project in 2015.</p>\n<h3>Embracing my Passion of Video Games</h3>\n<p><img src=\"html5-controller.png\"></p>\n<p>I have forever been trying to figure out a way to balance my love for gaming with my love for code.</p>\n<p>Between my Twitch stream, and constant watching of YouTubers, I've decided it makes more sense to just embrace my love for both and work through finding the balance.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure where it will go in 2015, but I have some ideas. I'll talk more on it in the New Year.</p>\n<h2>The Point</h2>\n<p>The whole point of this post is to actually sit down and share my self reflection on my professional and personal successes in order to try and figure out a plan for the next year.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone for their support throughout this rough 2014 and you can expect to see more of me and some this refreshed DW in 2015.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Highlight Reel for 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/highlight-reel-for-2014/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
