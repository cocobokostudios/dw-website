Get to the Point is <a href=\"http://youtu.be/M5OQchl9bQA\">the first video</a> of a series of short videos I plan on talking about code, video games, and hybrid topics in between.</p>\n<p>It's something I've wanted to do for quite some time now, and here's hoping I keep it up in 2015.</p>\n<h3>Viva la Blog</h3>\n<p>If you're reading this, then you might have noticed I've been blogging pretty regularily for the past few months. Not just here, but I had a <a href=\"http://d.wes.st/1yroBzI\">whole series on getting Ghost on Azure</a>, complete with a custom theme and SSL on the Canadian Developer Connection.</p>\n<p>The blog really was a great outlet for me to help me figure out what I wanted to do with my professional side, or whatever you want to call what I do.</p>\n<p>The plan is to keep that up. It's a good way for me to play around with ideas and content and share 'em with you fine people.</p>\n<h3>Back into the Speaker Spotlight</h3>\n<p>{% asset<em>img imaginet-html5event</em>small.jpg %}</p>\n<p>That's an old picture of me, but you can imagine that my reintroduction into public speaking looked that awesome.</p>\n<p>I took over a year off of public speaking, but broke the silence with a Winnipeg .NET User Group presentation I call Going Terminal: Learning to be IDE Free.</p>\n<p>In 2015, I'll be heading to <a href=\"http://www.prairiedevcon.com/\">Prairie Dev Con</a>, here in Winnipeg, to present on a new dev story where we go from Web to Mobile App using Cordova.</p>\n<h3>Actually Finishing Up Projects</h3>\n<p><img src=\"newzvgqtitle.PNG\"></p>\n<p>Given I consider my blog and website far from complete, I have made some serious strides in focusing the time I have to code projects and have actually seen progress.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/zvgq/zvgq\">biggest project</a> has been the \"New\" Zany Video Game Quotes website. Something I've been slowly working on with one of my closest friends for years. It's only now, nearly 5 years later, that I have something to show.</p>\n<p>I didn't quite get everything I wanted done for January 1, but I made some serious progress and have something to show for it.</p>\n<p>Expect more details on what I've learned and have planned for that project in 2015.</p>\n<h3>Embracing my Passion of Video Games</h3>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 230px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/1dafcfc1d8d13c6fb13e8820f3faab47/81c8e/html5-controller.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 76.07361963190185%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"html5 controller\"\n        title=\"html5 controller\"\n        src=\"/static/1dafcfc1d8d13c6fb13e8820f3faab47/81c8e/html5-controller.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/1dafcfc1d8d13c6fb13e8820f3faab47/222b7/html5-controller.png 163w,\n/static/1dafcfc1d8d13c6fb13e8820f3faab47/81c8e/html5-controller.png 230w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I have forever been trying to figure out a way to balance my love for gaming with my love for code.</p>\n<p>Between my Twitch stream, and constant watching of YouTubers, I've decided it makes more sense to just embrace my love for both and work through finding the balance.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure where it will go in 2015, but I have some ideas.
